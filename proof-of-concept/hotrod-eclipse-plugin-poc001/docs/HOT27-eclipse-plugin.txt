                                 Where:
                                  [<>]   Regenerate All.
                                  [Auto] Turns Auto Regeneration mode on/off.
                                  [>]    Regenerate autodetected changes only when Auto is off.
                                  [X]    Removes a HotRod config file from the view.
                                  [XX]   Removes all HotRod config files from the view.
                                  *      Signifies "dirty" state -- needs regeneration.

                                  * T/V/D are icons that correspond to "Table", "View", and "DAO".
                                  * Dirty state icons will be mostly useful when Auto mode is off, to let the user know a regeneration is needed.
                                  * Dirty state icons will remain there on failure for failed/non-executed DAOs. Completed ones will be cleared.
                                  * Dirty state icons will be shown on DAO parents also, such as fragments and main config file.
                                  * Only main HotRod config files can be loaded, not fragments.
                                  * Fragments are loaded in a subtree below the main HotRod config file.
                                  * Fragments cannot be loaded by themselves.
                                  * A successful HotRod execution will update the Java source tree.
                                  * An unsuccessful HotRod execution will also update the Java source tree.
                                  * An unsuccessful HotRod execution will open the Console View and will show the error(s).
 
         
Research how to:
================
 * [DONE] Add a tree "form" that lists all the fragments, with DAO state indicators.
 * [DONE] Drag and Drop one or more HotRod config files into the new view.
 * [DONE] Add functional buttons to the HotRod View tool bar.
 * [DONE] File listener: automatic reload when a config file changes. Mark all dirty DAOs.
 * [DONE] Reload the affected java source trees on success and failure conditions.
 * Shows execution errors in the Console View.
 * Double on a tree face loads the source file at the specific line. 
 * Set JDBC properties for each HotRod config file (driver class path, driver class, url, user, pass, catalog, schema, etc.)
 * Dynamically load a JDBC driver classpath for each HotRod config file separately.
