To run the HotRod Eclipse plugin locally for demo purposes:

The first time:
---------------

 -> right-click on the project
 -> Run As -> Run Configurations...
 
  On the left side select:
    -> Eclipse Application
      -> Eclipse Application
     
  On the right side:
    Location: ${project_loc}/test-workspace
    
  Then:
    -> Run
    
  A new Eclipse instance is started and takes a few seconds to be ready: this new instance includes the plugin. Once loaded:
  
  Import the project "project002" in this (testing) workspace:
    -> File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> [Next] 
    -> [Browse] -> "project002" -> [OK]
    
  Once the project002 is imported, open the HotRod View:
    -> Window -> Show View -> Other... -> HotRod Category -> HotRod

 -> Run As -> Eclipse Application
