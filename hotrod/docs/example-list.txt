Example 01 - CRUD Operations on Tables

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * insert
   * select by PK
   * update by PK
   * delete by PK

Example 02 - Using Sequences and Identity PKs

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * insert using identity PK
 * Table CLIENT:
   * insert using a sequence
 * Table BRANCH:
   * insert using an optional identity PK
 * Table DAILY_REPORT:
   * insert with no auto-generated PK
 * Table VISIT:
   * insert with no PK

Example 03 - Select by Example

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * select by example
     - select by a single column (TYPE)
     - select by multiple columns (BRAND + MODEL)
     - select using null values (BRAND + MODEL + null BRANCH_ID)

Example 04 - Update by Example

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * update by example
     - single column update example (MILEAGE)
     - multiple column update example (BRANCH, PRICE)
     - update using null on example (MILEAGE) / (TYPE, BRANCH_ID)
     - update using null on new values (BRANCH) / (TYPE, BRANCH_ID, SOLD)

Example 05 - Delete by Example

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * delete by example
     - delete using a single column criteria (SOLD)
     - delete using a multiple column criteria (SOLD, BRANCH_ID)
     - delete using null on the example (SOLD, BRANCH_ID)

Example 06 - Navigating Foreign Keys

 * Table VEHICLE to table BRANCH
   * Navigate to parent

 * Table BRANCH to table VEHICLE
   * Navigate to children
   
 * Table CLIENT to table CLIENT
   * Reflexive navigate to parent.

 * Table CLIENT to table CLIENT
   * Reflexive navigate to children.

Example 07 - Select by Unique Indexes

 * Table VEHICLE:
   * select by unique index (single column)
     - select by VIN
     - select by ENGINE_NUMBER
 * Table CLIENT:
   * select by unique index (composite index):
     - state + driver's license number

Example 08 - Select on Views

 * View CAR
   * select by example

Example 09 - Retrieving Sequence Values
 * Sequence CLIENT_SEQ
   * retrieve a value

Example 10 - Regular SQL Queries

 * Table CLIENT & table PURCHASE
   * upgrade to VIP all clients who have bought at least N cars
   * delete CLIENTs that haven't bought anything.

Example 11 - Custom DAOs

 * DAO DailyOperations
   * query: updateDailyTotals()
   * sequence: getPDFReportFileSequence()
   * query: createDailyReport()
   * query: closeDay()

Example 12 - Regular SQL Selects

 * Table VEHICLE & Table PURCHASE
   * retrieve columns from multiple tables
   * retrieve aggregated columns
   * use subqueries

Example 13 - Native SQL

 * Table VEHICLE
   * SELECT * FROM TEST LIMIT 100
   * native function: SELECT ID, IFNULL(OWNER_NAME, 'N/A') FROM VEHICLE
   * SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
   * insert special types: INSERT INTO GEO_TABLE(THE_GEOM) VALUES ('POINT(500 505)'),
   * recursive table:
        CREATE TABLE FOLDER(ID INT PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(255), PARENT INT);

        INSERT INTO FOLDER VALUES(1, null, null), (2, 'src', 1),
        (3, 'main', 2), (4, 'org', 3), (5, 'test', 2);

        WITH LINK(ID, NAME, LEVEL) AS (
            SELECT ID, NAME, 0 FROM FOLDER WHERE PARENT IS NULL
            UNION ALL
            SELECT FOLDER.ID, IFNULL(LINK.NAME || '/', '') || FOLDER.NAME, LEVEL + 1
            FROM LINK INNER JOIN FOLDER ON LINK.ID = FOLDER.PARENT
        )
        SELECT NAME FROM LINK WHERE NAME IS NOT NULL ORDER BY ID;   
  
Example 14 - Dynamic SQL

 * Table CLIENT, table PURCHASES
   * select CLIENT with
     - a minimum number of purchases
     - from a specific state
     - created in the last N days
     
 * Table CLIENT, table BRANCH
   * update unsold VEHICLEs. Set:
      - discount X dollars
      - set MOVE_TO_BRANCH
     filter by criteria:
      - are from a specific BRANCH
      - in a price range
      - of a specific type

Example 15 - Transactions & Isolation Levels

 * Table VEHICLE, table PURCHASE, table CLIENT
   - mark VEHICLE as sold
   - insert a PURCHASE row
   - increment CLIENT purchases by one and amount by the price

Example 16 - Optimistic Locking (Row Version Control)

 * Table CLIENT
   - update CLIENT type

Example 17 - Custom DAO Class Names

 * Table DLY_RP002
   - use it as DailyReportDAO to insert, delete, update, and by example.
   - custom SQL queries and custom SELECTs still use the original name.

Example 18 - Custom DAO Property Names

 * Table DLY_RP002 with legacy column names.
   - use it as DailyReportDAO to insert, delete, update, and by example.
   - custom SQL queries and custom SELECTs still use the original name.

Example 19 - Custom DAO Property Java Types

 * Table DLY_RP002 with legacy column names.
   - use it as DailyReportDAO to insert, delete, update, and by example.
   - custom SQL queries and custom SELECTs still use the original name.

Example 20 - Fragments

 * Divide the configuration file into fragments:
   - main fragment
   - sales fragment
   - accounting fragment

Example 21 - Facets

 * Regenerate only a subset of tables
 
Example 22 - Including Existing MyBatis Mappers

 * Existing MyBatis Mappers to select, insert, update, and delete
