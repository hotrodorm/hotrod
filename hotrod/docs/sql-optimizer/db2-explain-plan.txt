Prepare the explain plan functionality on your user. You'll need to do this only the first time this specific user performs the explain plan funcitonality. SSH to the database server. Then:

* Connect to the database:
 db2 connect to empusa
 
* Initialize DB2's explain tables:
 db2 -tf sqllib/misc/EXPLAIN.DDL

Now, through JDBC (or SQL) run the explain command on your SQL. For example:

 explain plan for     
 select t.*, a.current_balance, a.name as account_name, b.name as branch_name
   from transaction t
   join account a on t.account_id = a.id
   join federal_branch b on t.fed_branch_id = b.id
   where a.current_balance >= 200 
     and t.amount < 100
