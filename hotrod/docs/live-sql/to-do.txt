Done:
=====

 - IN (constant...) / NOT IN (constant...)
 - Each table/view instance is referenced once at most.
 - All tables/view have different aliases (the declared ones).

Priority #1:
============

 - Fix NumberExpression operators. They can't be applied to NumberColumn.
 - Fix precedence in operators.

Priority #2:
============

 - Implement UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.
      y SELECT
      y FROM/JOIN
      y WHERE
      y GROUP BY
      y HAVING
      x ORDER BY
      x OFFSET
      x LIMIT
 - Validate all result set columns have names and all names are different (ignoring letter case).

Priority #3:
============

 - Grouping rules. Result set columns can be only one of the following:
     * a column named in the GROUP BY clause.
     * an aggregation expression.
     * a column directly dependent on a GROUP BY column.
 - Having rules. Same rules as GROUP BY.
 - validate operator types for IN operator to subqueries.
 
Defects:
========

 - When multiple columns have the same name with different letter case, the generated source
   code becomes invalid because of duplicate setters/getters, ordering, etc.
