*1 Combinable queries are the second, third, etc. query in a UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT sequence. They 
   cannot have ORDER BY, OFFSET, LIMIT; those clauses belong to the first query in the sequence.
*2 SQL Server 2014 can only include ORDER BY when OFFSET and FETCH are also included.
*3 MariaDB 10.3 & MySQL 8.0 do not support OFFSET & LIMIT in these type of subqueries.
*4 Only Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server support lateral selects.
*5 DB2 implements LIMIT. It seems it's part of the SQL standard but most engines usually say something like: "This version of MariaDB doesn't yet support 'global ORDER_BY/LIMIT in recursive CTE spec'".
*6 PostgreSQL, MariaDB, H2 implement OB/LIMIT/OFFSET in the recursive member if it's enclosed in parenthesis.
