*1 Combinable queries are the second, third, etc. query in a UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT sequence. They 
   cannot have ORDER BY, OFFSET, LIMIT; those clauses belong to the first query in the sequence.
*2 SQL Server 2014 can only include ORDER BY when OFFSET and FETCH are also included.
*3 MariaDB 10.3 & MySQL 8.0 do not support OFFSET & LIMIT.
