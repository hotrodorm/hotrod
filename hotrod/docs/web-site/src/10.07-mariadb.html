<h1>Support for MariaDB database</h1>

<p>
  Please refer to the section<a href="./10.06-mysql.html"> Support
    for MySQL database</a>.
</p>

<p>The HotRod MariaDB adapter automatically maps known database
  column types to DAO Java types using the exact same logic as the
  HotRod&#39;s MySQL adapter.</p>

<p>MariaDB is fully binary compatible with MySQL server. HotRod, as
  well as any other database client applications, does not notice any
  difference when running against MariaDB compared to MySQL, except for
  the database identification strings that reveal it&#39;s MariaDB.
  Apart from that, the database behaves exactly the same way.</p>
