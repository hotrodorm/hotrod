<h1>Example 12 - Regular SQL Selects</h1>

<p>This example shows how to run regular (free) SQL selects.</p>

<p>SQL selects must be configured in the configuration file. See the
  reference section for details on their syntax and how to define their
  parameters.</p>

<p>SQL selects are exposed in the DAOs as simple java methods with
  the configured java parameters.</p>

<p>Regular SQL selects shares the syntax with Native SQL and Dynamic
  SQL. They can be combined all at once when creating SQL statements.</p>

<p>SQL selects can include &lt;column&gt; tags to force the Java
  name and Java type of the result set. When included they need to be
  included outside the CDATA section, if any.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Example 12</strong> is included in the download package.
  To run this example please refer to the section How to Run the
  Examples above.
</p>

<h2>Case #1: Columns from a single table</h2>

<p>The configuration file includes the SQL select that retrieves
  clients created between two dates using the following SQL statement:</p>

<pre class="xml">  &lt;select java-class-name="CreatedClient">
  &lt;![CDATA[
    select * from client
      {* 
      where created_at between #{since,javaType=java.sql.Date,jdbcType=DATE}
                           and #{until,javaType=java.sql.Date,jdbcType=DATE}
      *}
  ]]>
  &lt;/select></pre>

<p>
  The SQL select can be run using the
  <code>select(java.sql.Date since, java.sql.Date until)</code>
  Java method on the DAO
  <code>CreatedClient</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #2: Join returns fully-typed, fully-named columns from
  multiple tables</h2>

<p>
  A new DAO Java class is generated to include the <strong>fully-typed</strong>,
  <strong>fully-named</strong> returned columns for both tables on the
  SQL select. The configuration file includes the SQL select performs
  the SQL join:
</p>

<pre class="xml">  &lt;select java-class-name="ClientWithPurchase">
  &lt;![CDATA[
    select p.*, c.vip, c.state from purchase p
      join client c on (c.id) = (p.client_id)
      {*
      where p.purchase_date =
        #{purchaseDate,javaType=java.sql.Date,jdbcType=DATE}
      *}
  ]]>
  &lt;/select></pre>

<p>
  The SQL select can be run using the
  <code>select(java.sql.Date purchaseDate)</code>
  Java method on the DAO
  <code>ClientWithPurchase</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Grouping and adding extra columns</h2>

<p>
  A new DAO Java class is generated to include the <strong>fully-typed</strong>,
  <strong>fully-named</strong> returned columns from the SQL select. The
  configuration file includes the following SQL select:
</p>

<pre class="xml">  &lt;select java-class-name="DailyTotal">
  &lt;![CDATA[
    select 
        purchase_date, 
        count(*) as number_of_purchases, 
        sum(vehicle_price) as price, 
        sum(extras_price) as extras, 
        sum(discount) as discount, 
        sum(tax) as taxes, 
        sum(final_price) as revenue
      from purchase
      {*
      where purchase_date between #{from,javaType=java.sql.Date,jdbcType=DATE}
                              and #{to,javaType=java.sql.Date,jdbcType=DATE}
      group by purchase_date
      *}
  ]]>
  &lt;/select></pre>

<p>
  The SQL select can be run using the
  <code>select(java.sql.Date from, java.sql.Date to)</code>
  Java method on the DAO
  <code>DailyTotal</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #4: Subqueries</h2>

<p>
  A new DAO Java class is generated to include the <strong>fully-typed</strong>,
  <strong>fully-named</strong> returned columns from the SQL select. The
  configuration file includes the following SQL select:
</p>

<pre class="xml">  &lt;select java-class-name="ClientNeverOfferedDiscount">
  &lt;![CDATA[
    select * from client where id not in 
      (select client_id from purchase where discount > 0)
  ]]>
  &lt;/select></pre>

<p>
  The SQL select can be using the
  <code>select()</code>
  Java method on the DAO
  <code>ClientNeverOfferedDiscount</code>
  .
</p>
