<h1>Example 4 - Update by Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to update rows on tables using the
  out-of-the-box Update by Example functionality. This functionality is
  available on all database tables even if they don&#39;t have a PK.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Example 04</strong> is included in the download package.
  To run this example please refer to the section How to Run the
  Examples above.
</p>

<h2>Case #1: Filtering by a single column</h2>

<p>To update using a single column you must instantiate a new DAO to
  use as the example and set the desired value on the property you want
  to filter by. Leave the rest of the properties untouched. Instantiate
  a second DAO to set the new values you want to update.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #2: Filtering by and updating multiple columns</h2>

<p>To update filtering by multiple columns you must instantiate a
  new DAO to use as the example and set the desired values on the
  properties you want to filter by. An AND logic condition is used to
  filter by all the columns. Leave the rest of the properties untouched.
  Instantiate a second DAO to set the new values you want to update.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Using null values to filter and/or update</h2>

<p>To update filtering using null values you must explicitly set the
  null value into the properties(s) you want to filter by. An AND logic
  condition is used to filter by all the columns. Leave the rest of the
  properties untouched.</p>

<p>Instantiate a second DAO to set the new values you want to
  update, including the null values to be set.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #4: Update all rows</h2>

<p>To update all rows of the table just don&#39;t set any property
  of the DAO used as the example.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
