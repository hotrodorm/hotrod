<h1>Example 15 - Database Transactions</h1>

<p>This example shows how to use database transactions.</p>

<p>The DAOs for MyBatis operate by default in auto-commit mode. That
  is, every single insert, delete, and update commits its execution
  right away without need to specify it.</p>

<p>However, when transactions are required to group multiple
  database operations the DAOs provide a simple TxManager object that
  allows the code to initiate, commit, rollback, and free transaction
  resources.</p>

<p>Since behind the scenes MyBatis is controlling all transactions,
  many features of it are available such as locally controlled
  transactions, or participation in external transactions using JTA.</p>

<p>Transactions can also be linear or interleaved, the latter only
  available if supported by the database and JDBC driver.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Example 15</strong> is included in the download package.
  To run this example please refer to the section How to Run the
  Examples above.
</p>

<h2>Case #1: No transaction</h2>

<p>This case implements a cash transfer between two branches, that
  requires to decrement the cash on one and increment it on the other
  one.</p>

<p>Both SQL updates are executed without any transaction
  declaration. Since by default HotRod works in auto-commit mode, these
  operations are independent and are committed immediately and
  separately. A system crash could produce inconsistencies in the
  database state.</p>

<h2>Case #2: Standard transaction</h2>

<p>This case implements a cash transfer between two branches, that
  requires to decrement the cash on one and increment it on the other
  one.</p>

<p>
  Both SQL updates are executed within a transaction. These operations
  are not independent and are committed at once by the
  <code>commit()</code>
  method. A system crash will not produce inconsistencies in the
  database state.
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Custom transaction</h2>

<p>This case implements a cash transfer between two branches, that
  requires to decrement the cash on one and increment it on the other
  one.</p>

<p>
  The transaction raises the isolation level to
  <code>SERIALIZABLE</code>
  to prevent some level of concurrency in the database.
</p>

<p>
  Both SQL updates are executed within a transaction. These operations
  are not independent and are committed at once by the
  <code>commit()</code>
  method. A system crash will not produce inconsistencies in the
  database state.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Custom options on transaction may not be
  supported by all databases.
</p>

<h2>Case #4: Interlaced transactions</h2>

<p>This case implements TWO cash transfers between four branches IN
  PARALLEL, that requires to decrement the cash on two of them and
  increment it on the other two.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Interlaced transactions are not common. You may
  want to use them on specialized cases when you really want some fine
  grained control over them. Even there, it&#39;s usually better to
  leave these intricacies to the data source pooling solution or
  application server.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Interlaced transactions may not be supported by
  all databases.
</p>

<p>All four SQL updates are executed intertwined in two SEPARATE
  independent transactions.&nbsp; A system crash will not produce
  inconsistencies in the database state. Also, a commit or rollback on
  one of the transactions does not produce a commit or rollback on the
  other one (they are fully independent).</p>
