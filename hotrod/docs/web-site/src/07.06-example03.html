<h1>Example 3 - Select by Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to select rows from tables using the
  out-of-the-box Select by Example functionality. This functionality is
  available on all database tables (and views) even if they don&#39;t
  have a PK.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>The Example 03 is included in the download package. To run this
  example please refer to the section How to Run the Examples above.</p>

<h2>Case #1: Filtering by a single column</h2>

<p>To select using a single column you must instantiate a new DAO to
  use as the example and set the desired value on the property you want
  to filter by. Leave the rest of the properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  all the rows with type &#39;
  <code>CAR</code>
  &#39;.
</p>

<h2>Case #2: Filtering by multiple columns</h2>

<p>To select using multiple columns you must instantiate a new DAO
  to use as the example and set the desired values on the properties you
  want to filter by. An AND logic condition is used to filter by all the
  columns. Leave the rest of the properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  all the rows with
  <code>BRAND</code>
  &#39;
  <code>Toyota</code>
  &#39; and
  <code>MODEL</code>
  &#39;
  <code>Tercel</code>
  &#39;.
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Using null values</h2>

<p>To select using null values you must explicitly set the null
  value into the properties(s) you want to filter by. An AND logic
  condition is used to filter by all the columns. Leave the rest of the
  properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  all the rows with
  <code>BRAND</code>
  &#39;
  <code>Toyota</code>
  &#39; and
  <code>MODEL</code>
  &#39;
  <code>Tercel</code>
  &#39;, with a
  <code>null</code>
  value on the
  <code>BRANCH_ID</code>
  column.
</p>

<h2>Case #4: Adding ordering</h2>

<p>
  To specify the order of the returned columns you can add extra
  parameters when calling the
  <code>selectByExample()</code>
  method.
</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  by adding values from the generated
  <code>VehicleDAOOrderBy</code>
  enum.
</p>

<h2>Case #5: Using case-insensitive ordering</h2>

<p>Case-insensitive ordering is available for String-like columns.
  The generated enum for the DAO includes a variant for
  case-insensitivity.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  by adding values from the generated
  <code>VehicleDAOOrderBy</code>
  enum.
</p>

<h2>Case #6: Using stable case-insensitive ordering</h2>

<p>Case-insensitive ordering is available for String-like columns.
  The generated enum for the DAO includes a variant for stable
  case-insensitivity. This variant sorts by the case-insensitive value,
  and additionally sort by plain value.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated selecting from the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  by adding values from the generated
  <code>VehicleDAOOrderBy</code>
  enum.
