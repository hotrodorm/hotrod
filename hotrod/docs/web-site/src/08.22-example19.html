<h1>Example 19 - Custom DAO Property Types</h1>

<p>This example shows how the DAO properties from tables, views, and
  selects can be forced by the developer.</p>

<p>HotRod automatically produces Java types according to the
  database column type. Even though these Java types are usually
  adecuate to accomodate database values, sometimes the developer may
  have different preference. If this is the case, the type can be forced
  by the developer by specifying it in the configuration file.</p>

<h2>Case #1: Using a Double rathen than a java.math.BigDecimal</h2>

<p>
  By default HotRod produces a column with the Java type
  <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code>
  for the column of type
  <code>NUMERIC(10, 2)</code>
  . However, in this case the developer prefers to treat this number as
  a
  <code>java.lang.Double</code>
  and specifies it in the configuration file as shown below:
</p>

<pre class="xml">    &lt;column name="$valuation" java-name="totalBranchValuation"
      java-type="java.lang.Double" /></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
