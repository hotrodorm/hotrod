<h1>Configuration Reference Overview</h1>

<p>HotRod&#39;s Configuration File is a key aspect of the code
  generator. This file gathers more than a decade of experience of the
  authors on code generation for different projects with diverse needs.</p>

<p>In it simplest form, the configuration file includes a list of
  the tables the application uses. You can generate a comprehensive
  persistence layer for MyBatis just by writing a few lines in the
  configuration file.</p>

<p>In more advanced form, this file can specify multiple aspects of
  the code generation or add tweaks to it. It&#39;s not required for a
  developer to learn all the tweaks right from the beginning, but he/she
  will find them useful later on during the project when the need
  arises.</p>

<p>When using it comprehensively, the configuration file can specify
  Java names and types for DAOs, add optimized SQL sentences, provide
  facets subset regeneration, add custom DAOs,&nbsp;&nbsp; divide it in
  separate areas, and other tweaks. These are advanced features useful
  for more optimized projects, when having multiple modules, or when
  having many developers.</p>

<h2>The Main Structure</h2>

<p>The configuration file includes a generators section that
  stipulates details on the whole code generation, and then the details
  of the database objects that will be considered on it.</p>

<p>The header of the configuration file specifies the main
  directives to HotRod. Among others, it defines the directory structure
  for the generated files such as the DAO Java classes, MyBatis mappers,
  and MyBatis main configuration file.</p>

<p>The example shown below, taken from the Hello World example
  application, depicts these sections:</p>


<pre class="xml" style="background-color: #e7e7e7;">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE hotrod SYSTEM "hotrod.dtd">

&lt;hotrod></pre>

<pre class="xml" style="background-color: #ffefef;">  &lt;generators>
    &lt;mybatis>
      &lt;daos gen-base-dir="auto-generated/java" dao-package="daos" />
      &lt;mappers gen-base-dir="auto-generated/mappers" relative-dir="persistence" />
      &lt;mybatis-configuration-template file="mybatis-template.xml" />
      &lt;session-factory singleton-full-class-name="sessionfactory.DatabaseSessionFactory" />
      &lt;select-generation temp-view-base-name="hotrod_temp_view" />
    &lt;/mybatis>
  &lt;/generators></pre>


<pre class="xml" style="background-color: #e6e6ff;">  &lt;table name="vehicle">
    &lt;auto-generated-column name="id" />
  &lt;/table></pre>


<pre class="xml" style="background-color: #e7e7e7;">&lt;/hotrod></pre>


<p>The gray section corresponds to boilerplate text and should be
  included verbatim. They correspond to the main XML structure and
  definition of the XML grammar.</p>

<p>The section in red corresponds to the generators section. It
  provides details on how the generated code will be produced. There are
  two generators available in HotRod: the MyBatis Generator, and the
  Spring JDBC Generator.</p>

<p>The section in blue includes the full list of database objects
  your application uses. In this case this section is very short and
  includes a single table. More developed applications include a bulk of
  definitions in here.</p>

<p>For details on the MyBatis Generators options section see the
  MyBatis Generator section.</p>

<p>For details on the list of database objects see the corresponding
  Configuration Reference section for Tables, Views, Selects, Custom
  DAOs, Updates, Sequences, Fragments and Facets.</p>
