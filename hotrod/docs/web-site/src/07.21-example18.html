<h1>Example 18 - Custom DAO Property Names</h1>

<p>This example shows how the DAO properties from tables and views
  can have a custom user-specified names, rather than the equivalent
  names coming directly from the database object.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>The Example 18 is included in the download package. To run this
  example please refer to the section How to Run the Examples above.</p>

<h2>Case #1: Java reserved word</h2>

<p>
  If no alias is used for the column &quot;
  <code>IF</code>
  &quot;, it would generate the java property name &quot;
  <code>if</code>
  &quot;. This is actually a reserved word in Java and, therefore, the
  DAO source code would be invalid. In this case the property MUST be
  given a different java name.
</p>

<p>
  In the configuration file the
  <code>if</code>
  property is given the java name
  <code>valuationDate</code>
  , as shown below:
</p>

<pre class="xml">    &lt;column name="if" java-name="valuationDate" /></pre>

<h2>Case #2: Cryptic column name</h2>

<p>
  The column name &quot;
  <code>SLDBRID</code>
  &quot; is a little bit cryptic and probably comes from a legacy system
  that we cannot modify. If we want to treat this column with a
  different name within our java application we can specify it in the
  configuration file as in:
</p>

<pre class="xml">    &lt;column name="sldbrid" java-name="branchId" /></pre>

<p>
  In this case it&#39;s much clearer for our Java application to use it
  as
  <code>branchId</code>
  in all getters and setters.
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Safer Java identifier</h2>

<p>
  The column &ldquo;
  <code>$valuation</code>
  &rdquo; (probably from a legacy database) has a special character in
  its name and could produce issues when interacting with the DAO
  properties. It&#39;s better to give it a different java name so it can
  be managed easily as shown below:
</p>

<pre class="xml">    &lt;column name="$valuation" java-name="totalBranchValuation" /></pre>

<p>
  The property name
  <code>totalBranchValuation</code>
  is much safer than &ldquo;
  <code>$valuation</code>
  &rdquo;.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
