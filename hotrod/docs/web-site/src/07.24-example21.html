<h1>Example 21 - Facets</h1>

<p>Facets allow the developer to perform partial regeneration the
  DAOs source code.</p>

<p>This can be useful when the database is large and/or slow to
  respond. It usually happens you add a single column into a table and
  would prefer to regenerate that specific table only instead of the
  whole database.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Example 21</strong> is included in the download package.
  To run this example please refer to the section How to Run the
  Examples above, but with a variation from the standard instructions:
</p>

<p>
  Instead of running the
  <code>hotrod</code>
  Ant task, run the
  <code>hotrod-visits-dev</code>
  Ant task. HotRod will run much faster since it will only regenerate
  the
  <code>VISIT</code>
  table and the
  <code>DailyOperations</code>
  DAO.
</p>

<p>Notice it doesn&#39;t matter where the facets are defined in
  relation to the fragment files. All parts of the facets are combined
  when the configuration file (and fragments) are read.</p>
