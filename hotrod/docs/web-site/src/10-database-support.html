<h1>Supported Databases & Column Types</h1>

<p>HotRod provides support for the major databases players in the
  market by retrieving and interpreting the database metadata these
  databases provide through the JDBC driver.</p>

<p>Common column types are supported by database adapter classes
  that know the particularities of each database and how to treat it.
  However, not all column types supported by a database is supported by
  HotRod. Some of them are limited at the JDBC driver level, since its
  implementation does not consider it at all. In other cases the
  implementation is rather obscure, or may rely entirely on very
  particular driver classes to interact with it.</p>

<p>The sections below document the support for each one of the
  databases HotRod supports.</p>
