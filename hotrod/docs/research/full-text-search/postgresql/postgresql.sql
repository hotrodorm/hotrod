-- Notes:
-- The extra column searchable_content is not required, but recommended
-- The extra column needs to be updates when the content is updated. Usually:
--   a) Using a trigger on every row update.
--   b) Using an hourly/daily process -- searches won't be precise until next hour/day.

-- 1. Create & populate the table
