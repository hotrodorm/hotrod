SAP ASE Optimizer Results
=========================

COULD NOT RUN ANY TEST AGAINST SAP ASE, SINCE IT DOES NOT RESPOND ANYMORE!

[TBD]

===================================

1. Optimizer use of index equality
----------------------------------

The optimizer DOES EXECUTE an "Index Range Scan" as shown below.

set showplan on

select * from "order" o 
  where o.id between 22501 and 22704 -- selectivity = 204 / 50000 = 0.004

2. Optimizer use of index range
-------------------------------

The optimizer PERFORMS an "Index Range Scan" as shown below.

set showplan on

select * from "order" o 
  where o.placed > '2017-11-15' -- selectivity = 2038 / 50000 = 0.041

3. Dual index usage
-------------------

The optimizer DOES NOT PERFORM a dual "Index Range Scan", but a simple full table scan.

set showplan on

select * from "order" o 
  where o.placed > '2018-02-01' -- selectivity =  82 / 50000 = 0.0016
    or o.placed < '2012-10-21'  -- selectivity = 176 / 50000 = 0.0035
    -- total selectivity = 0.0016 + 0.0035 = 0.0051

4. Use index for like operator
------------------------------

The optimizer DOES NOT PERFORM a dual "Index Range Scan", but a simple full table scan.

set showplan on

select * from customer 
  where first_name like 'JO%' -- selectivity = 1589 / 30000 = 0.053
    and last_name like 'CO%'  -- selectivity = 1550 / 30000 = 0.052
    -- estimated selectivity = 0.053 * 0.052 = 0.0028
    -- real selectivity      = 84 / 3000 = 0.0028

5. Full Test of the Join order
------------------------------

The optimizer did not choose the best join order.

 * The chosen join order does not seem to be optimal or close to optimal. It uses:
     -> order -> customer -> code -> shipment -> address -> order_item -> product -> code
   Cost: ... 
   
 * The best join path appears to be:
      -> customer -> order -> code(oc) -> order_item -> code(ic) -> product -> shipment -> address
   Cost: 84        + 3      + 9         + 10          + 10        + 6        + 6         + 6 = 134 rows read.

set showplan on

select
    c.phone_number, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.address_id,
    a.id, a.line1, a.line2, a.city, a.state, a.zip_code,
    i.deferred_shipment_date, i.quantity, ic.caption, oc.caption,
    p.description, s.shipped_on
  from
    "order" o
    join order_item i on i.order_id = o.id
    left join product p on i.product_id = p.id
    join customer c on c.id = o.customer_id
    left join shipment s on s.id = o.shipment_id
    left join address a on a.id = s.address_id
    join code oc on oc.id = o.status_code
    join code ic on ic.id = i.status_code
  where
        c.first_name like 'JO%' -- selectivity = 1589 / 30000 = 0.053
    and c.last_name like 'CO%'  -- selectivity = 1550 / 30000 = 0.052
    and oc.type = 'CLOSED'      -- selectivity = 4 / 8 = 0.5
    and ic.type = 'CLOSED'      -- selectivity = 4 / 8 = 0.5
    and o.placed > '2017-11-15' -- selectivity = 2038 / 50000 = 0.041
  order by
    c.id, o.id desc, s.id, i.id
