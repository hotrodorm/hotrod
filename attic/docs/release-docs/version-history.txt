2.0
---
 * Added full support for MyBatis.
 * Full foreign key relationships.
 * Added mapping for DB2, Oracle, MySQL, Hypersonic, and Sybase.

2.1
---
 * Adding support for PostgreSQL.
 * MyBatis configuration template path is now relative to the main config file.
 * Adding user-specified column java types (and JDBC types).

2.2
---
 * Adding <view> tags to automate SQL views in addition to tables.
 
2.3
---
 * Adding <select> tags to automate DAO generation (read only) for complex select
   statements (with joins or any other elements).
 * Better error messaging while generating DAOs for views and selects.
 * Adding a Quick Start fully runnable example as part of the release.
 * Adding first version of the full documentation.
 
2.4
---
 * Allow multiple use of the same parameter in select statements. The first 
   occurrence is considered the definition, and subsequent occurrences of
   the parameter (same name) are considered references. The DAO only includes
   a single parameter for each name.
 * Error messages for malformed <select> statements now include the full 
   "create view" statement to ease debugging.
 * Fixing properties comments on DAO primitives.
 * Multiple identical unique indexes on a table, as well as multiple identical
   foreign keys are considered during the generation. It has been observed
   that PostgreSQL allows the user to duplicate and record identical 
   constraints. The DAO generator now considers this case and does not 
   generate invalid java code.

2.5
---
 * Support for lower case column names. All columns are now enclosed in double
   quotes in the mappers files.
   
2.6
---
 * Support for MyBatis dynamic SQL. MyBatis dynamic SQL are automated as <select>
   tags. Due to limitations in the XML parser (Digester), the content of the <select>
   tag must be typed as a CDATA (i.e. enclosed in <![CDATA[ and ]]>). All dynamic
   tags can use < and >, but the included SQL must use &lt; and &gt; instead.
 * Fixed camel case java parameter names.
    
2.7
---
 * Version number pattern implemented for concurrency control of update and delete.
 * Configurable DAO and primitives packages, as well as DAO prefix/suffix and 
   primitives prefix/suffix.

2.8
---
 * Documenting HyperSQL and MySQL database property types.
 * Bug fix: Unique indexes on expressions are not used as exported keys (FK  
   target) anymore.
   
2.9
---
 * Configuration file renamed to hotrod.
 * Configuration file now supports fragments.
 * Configuration file now supports <sequence> and <update> tags on all daos:
   <table>, <view>, <select>, and <dao>
 * MariaDB support added.
 * Bug fix: the version control tag wasn't taken into consideration a corresponding
   <column> tag if specified, resulting in mismatching java types in the primitives.
