<h1>Welcome to HotRod!</h1>

<p>HotRod is a lightweight ORM for MyBatis. It generates and updates
  Java code and XML mappers automatically.</p>

<p>HotRod is also developing support for Spring JDCB and this
  generator is in experimental mode as of version 1.0.0.</p>

<p>HotRod&#39;s main goal is to dramatically reduce the amount of
  time devoted to writing and debugging the persistence layer of a Java
  application. HotRod uses JDBC to retrieve the structure of an existing
  database and generates all DAO Java classes that expose simple Java
  methods to perform all interaction with the database.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Simple Operations Available Out of the
      Box</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>All basic operations are made automatically available,
        including CRUD (simple insert, select, update, delete), foreign
        key navigation, selection using unique indexes, and select,
        update, delete by example queries.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Full Standard SQL</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Yes, full-fledged standard (parameterized) SQL statements
        are totally automated. The developer provides the SQL, and
        HotRod takes care of the rest generating fully-named,
        fully-typed Java classes.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Native SQL</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Yes, all tweaks of the native non-standard (parameterized)
        SQL are supported: think using non-standard functions, limit
        returned rows, hinting of execution plans, in-memory storage,
        access uncommitted data, etc. The developer provides the native
        SQL, and HotRod takes care of the rest generating fully-named,
        fully-typed Java classes.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Dynamic SQL</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Adds the capabilities of MyBatis Dynamic SQL to the
        Standard and Native SQL. Dynamic SQL statements vary at runtime
        depending on the received parameter values.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">No JDBC</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>The developer doesn&#39;t see any JDBC code anymore. Nada,
        nil, zip! Tables and views are abstracted as Java classes.
        Columns become fully-typed Java properties. SQL queries become
        parameterized Java methods. SQL selects become Java classes.

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Lightweight ORM</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Implements a straightforward lean O/R mapping that promotes
        high database performance. Does not implement table inheritance,
        aggregation or composition. It doesn't use heavy objects, no
        entity EBJs, no obscure caching, no Byzantine layer of
        abstraction.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Superior Development Speed</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>HotRod focuses on automating all the persistence coding it
        can. Simple database operations are automated out of the box.
        Complex SQL queries are greatly automated ensuring fully typed,
        fully named Java columns for all SQL selects.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Relational Database Performance</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>HotRod understands that relational databases are naturally
        not object oriented and hence leans toward squeezing relational
        database performance from your RDBMS instead of forcibly trying
        to abstract all their aspects in an OO model. Most commonly
        tables act as object containers; however, other database
        constructs such as sequences, views, SQL select, SQL updates,
        etc. do not follow this paradigm, and are more suitable to
        procedural usage than OO modeling.</p>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Custom Logic</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>All generated DAOs support adding custom logic to them.
        Upon database changes they can be rapidly regenerated without
        losing the custom logic.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td class="hero-title">Full Transaction Support</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Includes simplified MyBatis transactions and standard
        MyBatis transactions, and JTA (if supported by the JDBC driver
        and RDBMS).</p>
    </td>

    <td class="hero-title">Flexible</td>
    <td class="hero-desc">
      <p>Default DAO names, properties, Java method names, Java
        property types, etc. can be overridden by the developer as
        needed.</p>
