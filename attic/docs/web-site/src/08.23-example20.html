<h1>Example 20 - Fragments</h1>

<p>This example shows how the HotRod configuration file can be
  divided into separate files.</p>

<p>There are varied reasons why to separate the HotRod configuration
  file into smaller chunks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe it became just to largo to edit all at once.</li>
  <li>Maybe it wouls be useful to separate in modules or
    sub-modules.</li>
  <li>Maybe there are many developers and they keep generating
    repository conflicts since they are all updating the same unique
    file simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever the reason, the configuration file can be separated
  into fragments. The main one has a slightly different format since it
  includes the main configuration options for the generator. The
  fragments include database objects only.</p>

<p>Tables, views, selects, and custom DAOs, can grouped in any order
  between these fragments.</p>

<p>Fragment can include another sub-fragments, as long as there
  aren&#39t any circular references.</p>

<p>All the examples include a HotRod configuration separated in
  three files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hotrod.xml</code> (main configuration file)</li>
  <li><code>hotrod-sales.xml</code> (fragment)</li>
  <li><code>hotrod-accounting.xml</code> (fragment)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>This example is not runnable. Actually, all the examples use
  behind the scenes this configuration so you&#39;ve been running it all
  the time in the previous examples.</p>
