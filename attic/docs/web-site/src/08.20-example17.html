<h2>Case #1: Insert using a custom java DAO name</h2>

<p>
  A row is inserted in to the
  <code>MT_VVAL002</code>
  table using the corresponding DAO
  <code>VehicleValuationDAO</code>
  (name specified in the configuration file) for this table. This name
  is much clearer that the legacy name of the table (
  <code>MT_VVAL002</code>
  ) that is quite cryptic.
