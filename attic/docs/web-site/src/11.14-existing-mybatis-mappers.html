<h1>Existing MyBatis Code</h1>

<p>It may happen your project was already using MyBatis. If this is
  the case, then your project already has a set of DAOs/VOs Java classes
  and MyBatis mappers files. It may also happen you want to write your
  own MyBatis mappers in special cases, where you think very high fine
  tuning is necessary.</p>

<p>In any case, HotRod can leverage these mappers and combine them
  in the resulting MyBatis configuration file.</p>

<p>Any DAOs/VOs manually written outside HotRod are fully available
  by default to all the mappers. That is, the Java classes do not
  require any special treatment, as long as the are available in the
  classpath.</p>

<p>
  The mappers are a little bit different. HotRod can pick existing
  mappers&mdash;without touching them&mdash;if they are placed in the
  <code>custom</code>
  subdirectory of the
  <code>relative-dir</code>
  attribute specified in the configuration file for the
  <code>&lt;mapper&gt;</code>
  tag. Any mapper file found in this directory will be added to the list
  of mapper files in the resulting MyBatis configuration file.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The explanation above is correct, though a little bit dry.
  Let&#39;s try an example.</p>

<pre class="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE hotrod SYSTEM "hotrod.dtd">

&lt;hotrod>

  &lt;generators>
    &lt;mybatis>
      ...
      &lt;mappers gen-base-dir="mybatis-mappers" relative-dir="persistence" />
      ....
    &lt;/mybatis>
  &lt;/generators>

  &lt;table name="book" />

&lt;/hotrod></pre>

<p>
  Let&#39;s assume the directory structure of the project has a
  <code>mybatis-mappers/persistence</code>
  directory with a
  <code>custom</code>
  directory inside. Something like:
</p>

<pre>+- project/
   +- mybatis-mappers/
      +- persistence/
         +- custom/
            +- manga-queries.xml
            +- fiction-queries.xml</pre>

<p>
  HotRod&#39;s generation will produce a mapper for the
  <code>BOOK</code>
  table. It will also include both existing mapper files
  <code>manga-queries.xml</code>
  , and
  <code>fiction-queries.xml</code>
  , since they are in the directory it inspects for existing MyBatis
  mapper files. The resulting MyBatis configuration file will look like:
</p>

<pre class="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE configuration PUBLIC "-//mybatis.org//DTD Config 3.0//EN" "http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-config.dtd">
&lt;configuration>

  &lt;environments>
    ...
  &lt;/environments>

  &lt;mappers>
    &lt;mapper resource="persistence/primitives/primitives-book.xml" />
    &lt;mapper resource="persistence/custom/manga-queries.xml" />
    &lt;mapper resource="persistence/custom/fiction-queries.xml" />
  &lt;/mappers>

&lt;/configuration></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
