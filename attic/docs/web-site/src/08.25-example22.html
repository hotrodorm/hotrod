<h1>Example 22 - Including Existing MyBatis Mappers</h1>

<p>To include existing MyBatis mapper files, you&#39;ll need to
  place them into a special directory for HotRod to find them and
  include them in the main configuration file.</p>

<p>It may happen you have already developed multiple MyBatis mapper
  files that are well tested and fine tuned. Even though you could
  re-write them for HotRod, it may be better to use them as they are to
  avoid introducing any errors.</p>
