<h1>Example 5 - Delete by Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to delete rows on tables using the
  out-of-the-box Delete by Example functionality. This functionality is
  available on all database tables even if they don&#39;t have a PK.</p>
  
<h2>Example Source Code</h2>

<java-file name="docs/examples/mybatis/examples/java/examples/Example05.java" />

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>The Example 05 is included in the download package. To run this
  example please refer to the section How to Run the Examples above.</p>

<h2>Case #1: Filtering by a single column</h2>

<p>To delete using a single column you must instantiate a new DAO to
  use as the example and set the desired value on the property you want
  to filter by. Leave the rest of the properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #2: Filtering by multiple columns</h2>

<p>To delete filtering by multiple columns you must instantiate a
  new DAO to use as the example and set the desired values on the
  properties you want to filter by. An AND logic condition is used to
  filter by all the columns. Leave the rest of the properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Using null values to filter</h2>

<p>To delete filtering using null values you must explicitly set the
  null value into the properties(s) you want to filter by. An AND logic
  condition is used to filter by all the columns. Leave the rest of the
  properties untouched.</p>

<p>
  This is demonstrated using the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  .
