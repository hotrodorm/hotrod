<h1>Column Configuration Reference</h1>

<p>Columns are a central concept used in the DAO generation.
  Essentially all data sets retrieved from the database have a tabular
  form. When the data sets are retrieved each row is gathered as a
  single DAO (that is the DAO acting as a VO) and each column value for
  the row is placed in a DAO property.</p>

<p>In the simplest form&mdash;when directly dumping the content of a
  table&mdash;each column corresponds to a column on the related table.
  For example, when using a SQL query such as:</p>

<pre class="sql">  select * from vehicle</pre>

<p>This SQL query will produce a tabular data with the exact columns
  the originating table VEHICLE has.</p>

<p>However, when producing more elaborated SQL queries the resulting
  tabular data can have little resemblance to the originating database
  table. The following SQL query&mdash;based on the same
  table&mdash;returns a totally dissimilar tabular structure:</p>

<pre class="sql">  select avg(mileage/age) as mpy, age 
    from vehicle grouped by age</pre>

<p>
  In this case the resulting tabular structure has two columns and bares
  little resemblance to the
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  table.
</p>

<p>Columns are used by HotRod in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the basic CRUD operations of a database table. In this
    case each column has a one-to-one relationship with the related
    table. Each column produces a DAO property.</li>
  <li>For read operations on a database view. In this case each
    column has a one-to-one relationship with the view column.</li>
  <li>When running arbitrary SQL selects. In this case each column
    corresponds to a custom column from the resulting tabular data
    produced by the SQL select.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, why are we delving into all these details? Well, it happens
  that while most columns are very straightforward to interpret and use,
  other ones can be quite tricky to deal with.</p>

<p>
  Usually HotRod produces quite appropriate Java names and Java types
  for each column. However, in some cases the default names and/or types
  may not be the optimal ones according to the developer&#39;s
  expectations or needs. For example, the developer may consider some
  columns may be better interpreted by a different Java type (as a
  <code>java.lang.Double</code>
  , rather than as a
  <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code>
  ) based on extra business knowledge that is entirely out of scope for
  HotRod.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, the default attributes HotRod provides in some cases
  may not be the exact ones the developer wants. To overcome this
  obstacle the configuration file allows the developer to override
  default values using the
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag.
</p>

<p>
  To find out how the
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag affects the
  <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for the Tables.
</p>

<p>
  To find out how the
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag affects the
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for the Views.

  To find out how the
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag affects the
  <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for the Selects.
</p>

<h2>The &lt;column&gt; tag</h2>

<p>In most cases the metadata retrieved from the database is
  suitable enough to perform the whole code generation. In these cases
  there&#39;s nothing the developer will be interested on tweaking for
  the resulting tabular data.</p>

<p>There are, however, cases where the developer could change some
  settings. Typical cases are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the column name of an old or legacy column is cryptic, so the
    developer wants to use a nicer/clearer name for the DAO property. Or
    maybe there&#39;s a misspelling; yes, it happens.</li>
  <li>the default DAO property type for a column is not the one the
    developer prefers, and he/she wants to specify a different one.</li>
  <li>the column has an obscure database type and HotRod does not
    offer any default Java property type for it. A <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
    tag is necessary if the column needs to be used.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag attributes are:
</p>

<table class="data-table">

        the Supported Databases &amp; Column Types section regarding
        your specific database for details on how the Java types are
        produced.</td>

        only if you want to try how well different Java and/or JDBC
        types are handled by the JDBC driver when reading or writing
        data from and to the database. You probably would like to set
        this value only if you are having trouble with the JDBC driver,

</table>

<p>
  The most common attributes that are tweaked are
  <code>java-name</code>
  (for oddly named columns) and
  <code>java-type</code>
  (for not clear cut column types).
</p>

<p>The rest of the attributes are well worked out most of the time
  by the code generator, so there rarely any need to openly override
  their values.</p>
