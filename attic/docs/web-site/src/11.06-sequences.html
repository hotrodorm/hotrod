<h1>Sequences Configuration Reference</h1>

<p>Database sequences are available on the majority of
  databases&mdash;MySQL being a notable exception. Their purpose if to
  provide unique numbers to identify database elements, usually table
  rows.</p>

<p>
  Most of the time sequences are used to generate primary key values and
  are used in tandem with SQL insert statements. HotRod&#39;s
  <code>&lt;auto-generated-column&gt;</code>
  tag on the
  <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  tag implements this functionality.
</p>

<p>However, some times the application may have a need to retrieve
  sequential numbers for other purposes than immediately&mdash;or
  ever&mdash;inserting a row into a table. It could be the row may be
  eventually inserted after some other conditions are met, but the
  sequence number is needed right away for some purpose. It could be
  sequential numbers are needed to generate unique files in the file
  system, or to send identification numbers over the network to
  communicate with other applications.</p>

<p>Whatever the need is, sequences can provide unique numeric values
  to the Java application.</p>

<p>
  In HotRod one or more
  <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>
  tag can be added to any
  <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  ,
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  , or
  <code>&lt;dao&gt;</code>
  tag to produce Java methods that retrieve a sequence value from the
  database sequence.
</p>

<p>
  HotRod doesn&#39;t impose or require any relationship to exist between
  the sequence used by the
  <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>
  tag and the
  <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  ,
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  , or
  <code>&lt;dao&gt;</code>
  tags. The DAO Java classes produced by these tags only serve as
  containers to place the Java methods that retrieve the sequence
  values.
</p>

<p>
  The
  <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>
  tag attributes are:
</p>

<table class="data-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Attribute</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Required</strong></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>The name of the database sequence.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>java-method-name</td>
      <td>The name of the DAO Java method that will retrieve the
        sequence value, if different from the default name produced by
        HotRod. The default method name takes the form <code>selectSequence&lt;name&gt;()</code>.
      </td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
