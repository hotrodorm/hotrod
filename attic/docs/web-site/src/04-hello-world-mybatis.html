<h1>Hello World MyBatis!</h1>

<p>This Hello World example describes how to run a simple Hello
  World one-class application.</p>

<p>It demonstrates an SQL insert into a table that uses a DAO class,
  and goes step by step showing the details of how to set up the
  application and run the example.</p>

<p>For simplicity this Hello World demo runs as a command line Java
  application but with minimal changes it can also run on a JEE web
  container such as Tomcat, JBoss, Weblogic, or WebSphere.</p>

<h2>Apache Ant</h2>

<p>Apache Ant is used during the development of an application to
  automate all tasks related to the HotRod. Ant is not needed when the
  application is running or when deploying to a production environment.</p>

<p>
  This example uses Ant targets to run the database, to run the example,
  and to list database data. To learn more about Apache Ant see <a
    href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>. Ant was
  chosen since it can easily run java applications, and run other OS
  level tasks such as starting and stopping the database. All the Ant
  commands can be run from a terminal or within Eclipse IDE.
</p>

<p>
  To run the tasks from Eclipse you&#39;ll need to open the Eclipse Ant
  View (
  <code>Window</code>
  -&gt;
  <code>Show View</code>
  -&gt;
  <code>Ant</code>
  ), and then find the
  <code>build.xml</code>
  file for the Hello World example; drag and drop this file into the Ant
  View. Once there, expand it (small arrow icon on the left) to see all
  available tasks. To run any of them just double-click on it. The
  console window will be opened and will show the results of the
  execution.
</p>

<p>
  To run the tasks from the command line you&#39;ll need to have Ant
  installed at the OS level and in your path. Then make sure to move to
  the home folder of the Hello World example before running any task.
  For example, if you need to run the tasks
  <code>start-h2-database</code>
  , of the Hello World example type:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">cd examples/mybatis/helloworld
ant start-h2-database</pre>
</p>

<h2>Setting up the database</h2>

<p>
  This example uses a local H2 database. H2 was chosen since it&#39;s
  very easy to run locally without any installation; a simple command
  line launches it and it starts listening on a local network port for
  any JDBC client. To learn more about H2 database see <a
    href="http://www.h2database.com">http://www.h2database.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To start H2 run the Ant task
  <code>start-h2-database</code>
  . Type (or double click on it if using the Eclipse Ant View):
</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">ant start-h2-database</pre>

<p>The H2 database will start and you&#39;ll see an output like:</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
stop-h2-database:
-issue-h2-stop:
     [java] Shutting down TCP Server at tcp://localhost:12345
     [echo] [ H2 local database has been stopped ]
-h2-already-stopped:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds</pre>

<p>If you&#39;re unsure you started the H2 database you can run this
  command again. If it&#39;s already running it will find out and
  won&#39;t start it again.</p>

<p>To stop H2 run the Ant tasks stop-h2-database. Type (or double
  click on it if using the Eclipse Ant View):</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">ant stop-h2-database</pre>

<p>The H2 database will be stopped and you&#39;ll see an output
  like:</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
stop-h2-database:
-issue-h2-stop:
     [java] Shutting down TCP Server at tcp://localhost:12345
     [echo] [ H2 local database has been stopped ]
-h2-already-stopped:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds</pre>
</p>

<p>Please start H2 again and leave it running:</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">ant start-h2-database</pre>
</p>

<p>
  Now we will initialize the database; we&#39;ll create a table and
  insert some data in it. We&#39;ll run the following SQL statements
  (all included in the
  <code>prepare-database.sql</code>
  file):
</p>

<p>
<pre class="sql">drop table if exists vehicle;

create table vehicle (
  id integer identity primary key not null,
  brand varchar(30) not null,
  model varchar(30) not null,
  used boolean not null,
  current_mileage integer not null,
  purchased_on date
);

insert into vehicle (brand, model, used, current_mileage, purchased_on)
  values ('Kia', 'Soul', true, '28500', '2014-03-14');

insert into vehicle (brand, model, used, current_mileage, purchased_on)
  values ('Toyota', 'Tercel', false, '26', '2017-01-28');
  
insert into vehicle (brand, model, used, current_mileage, purchased_on)
  values ('DeLorean', 'DMC-12', true, '241689', '1982-11-17');</pre>
</p>

<p>As you see the table will be created and initialized with three
  rows of data. To run these SQL statements run the Ant task
  initialize-database. Type (or double click on it if using the Eclipse
  Ant View):</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">ant initialize-database</pre>
</p>

<p>All SQL statements will be executed and you&#39;ll see an output
  like:</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
initialize-database:
      [sql] Executing resource: prepare-database.sql
      [sql] 0 rows affected
      [sql] 0 rows affected
      [sql] 1 rows affected
      [sql] 1 rows affected
      [sql] 1 rows affected
      [sql] 5 of 5 SQL statements executed successfully
     [echo] [ Database tables and data initialized ]
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 894 milliseconds</pre>
</p>

<p>
  Well, with that the database is now ready. If you want to make sure
  the table and data are there you can use your favorite tool to connect
  to it and inspect it. Or, for simplicity, this example provides an Ant
  task that lists the rows in the table. To list the data run the Ant
  task
  <code>list-data</code>
  . Type (or double click on it if using the Eclipse Ant View):
</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">ant list-data</pre>
</p>

<p>A simple SQL select will display all the data on the table, and
  you&#39;ll see an output like:</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
list-data:
      [sql] Executing commands
      [sql] ID,BRAND,MODEL,USED,CURRENT_MILEAGE,PURCHASED_ON
      [sql] 1,Kia,Soul,TRUE,28500,2014-03-14
      [sql] 2,Toyota,Tercel,FALSE,26,2017-01-28
      [sql] 3,DeLorean,DMC-12,TRUE,241689,1982-11-17
      [sql] 0 rows affected
      [sql] 1 of 1 SQL statements executed successfully
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 789 milliseconds</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The output is a little bit crude but is good enough for our purposes.
  You can see three rows of data including the <strong>Kia Soul</strong>,
  the <strong>Toyota</strong> <strong>Tercel</strong>, and the <strong>DeLorean
    DMC-12</strong> in there. Congratulations! The database is now ready to be
  used.
</p>

<h2>Generate the DAOs using HotRod</h2>

<p>
  HotRod will generate a DAO class to interact with the
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  table. To do it HotRod needs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A database running with the tables that will be generated.</li>
  <li><code>hotrod.xml</code> - the HotRod configuration file.</li>
  <li><code>mybatis-template.xml</code> - a template of the MyBatis
    main configuration file, ready to be filled with the list of mapper
    files.</li>
  <li>The Ant task in the <code>build.xml</code> file.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>hotrod.jar</code> library.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The
  <code>hotrod.xml</code>
  configuration file is in the home folder and looks like:
</p>

<pre class="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE hotrod SYSTEM "hotrod.dtd">

&lt;hotrod>

  &lt;generators>
    &lt;mybatis>
      &lt;daos gen-base-dir="auto-generated/java" dao-package="daos" />
      &lt;mappers gen-base-dir="auto-generated/mappers"
          relative-dir="persistence" />
      &lt;mybatis-configuration-template file="mybatis-template.xml" />
      &lt;session-factory
          singleton-full-class-name="sessionfactory.DatabaseSessionFactory" />
      &lt;select-generation temp-view-base-name="hotrod_temp_view" />
    &lt;/mybatis>
  &lt;/generators>

  &lt;table name="vehicle">
    &lt;auto-generated-column name="id" />
  &lt;/table>

&lt;/hotrod></pre>

<p>
  In this example the
  <code>&lt;generators&gt;</code>
  tag includes the
  <code>&lt;mybatis&gt;</code>
  tag. The latter indicates the generated files will be placed into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>autogenerated/java</code> - all Java classes.</li>
  <li><code>autogenerated/mappers</code> - all MyBatis mappers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, the
  <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  tag tells HotRod to include the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  . Also, it specifies that the ID column is auto-generated as an
  identity column.
</p>

<p>To generate the DAOs, use the Ant task hotrod. Type (or double
  click on it if using the Eclipse Ant View):</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">ant hotrod</pre>
</p>

<p>HotRod retrieves the structure of the table VEHICLE and will
  generate the DAOs. you&#39;ll see an output like:</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
hotrod:
   [delete] Deleting directory auto-generated

   [hotrod] MyBatis generation complete.
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 887 milliseconds</pre>
<p>HotRod generated the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>auto-generated/java/daos/primitives/VehicleDAOPrimitives.java</code>
    - Abstract Java class that includes all the predefined methods to
    insert, delete, update, and select data from the <code>VEHICLE</code>
    table. One file is generated for each table. Do not modify this
    class since it&#39;s automatically rewritten by HotRod every time
    it&#39;s run, to reflect the latest changes of the database.</li>
  <li><code>auto-generated/java/daos/VehicleDAO.java</code> - Java
    class that extends from the <code>VehicleDAOPrimitives</code> class,
    so the developer can add custom logic to the DAO. One file is
    generated for each table. This source class is never rewritten by
    HotRod, to preserve all the custom logic.</li>
  <li><code>auto-generated/mappers/persistence/primitives/primitives-vehicle-dao.xml</code>
    - MyBatis mapper file that includes all the SQL statements needed to
    interact with the database. One file is generated for each table. Do
    not modify this class since it&#39;s automatically rewritten by
    HotRod every time it&#39;s run, to reflect the latest changes of the
    database.</li>
  <li>auto-generated/mappers/persistence/primitives/mybatis-configuration.xml
    - MyBatis main configuration file. This is a single file in the
    application. It&#39;s based in the <code>mybatis-template.xml</code>
    file in the root of the example, but it now lists all the mapper
    files just generated. Do not modify this class since it&#39;s
    automatically rewritten by HotRod every time it&#39;s run. Modify
    the template instead if you need to.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With these files all is ready to run the Hello World application.</p>

<h2>Run the Hello World application</h2>

<p>
  All the DAOs are ready and the Hello World application now needs to
  use them to insert a row into the database. The source code is in the
  <code>java/examples/HelloWorld.java</code>
  and includes the following lines of code:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="java">
    VehicleDAO skoda = new VehicleDAO();
    skoda.setBrand("Skoda");
    skoda.setModel("Octavia");
    skoda.setUsed(false);
    skoda.setCurrentMileage(7);
    skoda.setPurchasedOn(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
    skoda.insert();
    System.out.println("New vehicle Skoda added, with id " + skoda.getId() + ".");
</pre>

</p>

<p>
  First, a DAO object is instantiated to hold the values we want to
  insert in the new table row. Then, we set each one of the values and
  finally we execute the
  <code>insert()</code>
  method to insert the row.
</p>

<p>
  Note the
  <code>ID</code>
  property was not set. It&#39;s not needed since this column is
  auto-generated by the database. Since HotRod knows about it (as
  previously shown in the configuration file) its value is automatically
  retrieved upon insertion, and the
  <code>ID</code>
  property ends up with the newly created id value.
</p>

<p>
  To run the Hello World example, use the Ant task
  <code>helloworld</code>
  . Type (or double click on it if using the Eclipse Ant View):
</p>

<p>
<pre class="nohighlight">ant helloworld</pre>
</p>

<p>The output looks like:</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
helloworld:
   [delete] Deleting directory build
    [mkdir] Created dir: build
    [javac] Compiling 4 source files to build
     [echo]  
     [java] Example 1 - Hello World - Starting
     [java] New vehicle Skoda added, with id 4.
     [java] Example 1 - Hello World - Finished
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second</pre>

<p>
  The new row was added! To verify it&#39;s there you can use the
  <code>list-data</code>
  Ant task discussed earlier. Type (or double click on it if using the
  Eclipse Ant View):
</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">ant list-data</pre>

<p>The table now looks like:</p>

<pre class="nohighlight">Buildfile: build.xml
list-data:
      [sql] Executing commands
      [sql] ID,BRAND,MODEL,USED,CURRENT_MILEAGE,PURCHASED_ON
      [sql] 1,Kia,Soul,TRUE,28500,2014-03-14
      [sql] 2,Toyota,Tercel,FALSE,26,2017-01-28
      [sql] 3,DeLorean,DMC-12,TRUE,241689,1982-11-17
      [sql] 4,Skoda,Octavia,FALSE,7,2017-01-28
      [sql] 0 rows affected
      [sql] 1 of 1 SQL statements executed successfully
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 756 milliseconds</pre>

<p>
  ...and there it is! A fourth row is now shown with the <u>Skoda
    Octavia</u> vehicle. Incidentally, we can see its id actually has the
  value 4.
</p>

<p>That&#39;s it! You have set up the HotRod application and
  configuration, you created a database with a table, then you generated
  the DAO classes using HotRod, and finally you ran the application.
  Congratulations!</p>

<p>Once done, don&#39;t forget to stop the H2 database! I always do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
