<h1>FAQ</h1>

<div class="question">Can I update on a view?</div>
<div class="answer">No. The current version of HotRod support
  retrieving data from a view but does not support updating on views.
  RDBMS differ on which views can be updates but in general they allow
  SQL inserts, updates, and deletes on simple views. HotRod may support
  these operations in the future.</div>

<div class="question">Can I run an exotic SQL that use
  database-specific syntax?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes. All SQL selects and updates can be
  automated by HotRod. As long as the JDBC driver is able to run them,
  HotRod can create the corresponding DAOs for it.</div>
