<h1>Views Configuration Reference</h1>

<p>HotRod can leverage existing database views by providing DAO Java
  classes that retrieve data rows from them. It does not support,
  however, updating, deleting, or inserting of them.</p>

<p>Technically speaking database views can also be updated under
  some circumstances but these end up being quite varied for different
  databases. In general, updatable views tend to be based on simple
  queries and/or a single table, but this is not set in stone.</p>

<h2>The &lt;view&gt; Tag</h2>

<p>
  The
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag tells HotRod which database views you want to use. Each
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag adds one view to the code generation and produces a DAO. This DAO,
  however, will be much more limited than a table DAO since it can only
  select rows using the &quot;by example&quot; strategy.
</p>

<p>
  The
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag attributes are:
</p>

<table class="data-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Attribute</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Required</strong></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>The name of the database view.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>java-name</td>
      <td>The name of the DAO Java class, if different from the
        default name produced by HotRod.</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Most of the time a view definition is quite succinct. It only declares
  the view name and all the needed metadata is retrieved by HotRod from
  the database to produce all the DAO properties and methods. In this
  simple form the
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag may look like:
</p>

<pre class="xml">  &lt;view name="luxury_car" /></pre>

<p>
  This informs HotRod there&#39;s an
  <code>LUXURY_CAR</code>
  view that is to be included in the code generation. The DAO Java
  name&mdash;and the properties names for its columns&mdash;will be
  generated by default from the database view structure, and the Java
  types will also be produced using the default rules HotRod has for
  this specific database. Basically, there is no custom configuration on
  it.
</p>

<p>
  The name of the DAO Java class is taken from the view name, and
  prepended and appended with the prefix and suffix as specified in the
  header configuration section of the configuration file. By default
  there&#39;s no prefix, and by default the suffix is DAO. Therefore, in
  the example above the
  <code>LUXURY_CAR</code>
  view will produce the DAO Java class
  <code>LuxuryCarDAO.java</code>
  .
</p>

<p>
  Now, if you want to use a different name for the DAO Java class, you
  can specify it in the
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag using the
  <code>java-name</code>
  attribute. Mind this name must be a valid Java class name, starting
  with an upper case letter. If, for example, we wanted to use a custom
  name for the DAO the configuration could look like:
</p>


<pre class="xml">  &lt;view name="luxury_car" java-name="LuxuryVehicle" /></pre>

<p>
  This configuration will produce the DAO Java class
  <code>LuxuryVehicle.java</code>
  . Notice that when you openly specify the DAO Java name, HotRod does
  not prepend or append the prefix and suffix, but it takes it exactly
  as you declared it.
</p>

<h2>The &lt;column&gt; Tag</h2>

<p>
  Each
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag can include one or more
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tags to stipulate specific properties for some or all the columns of
  the view. The view columns with no
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  definition use the default properties provided by the code generator.
</p>

<p>
  For details on the settings of a
  <code>&lt;column&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for Columns.
</p>

<h2>The &lt;sequence&gt; Tag</h2>

<p>
  Each
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag can include one or more
  <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>
  tags. These definitions generate a Java method to directly retrieve a
  value from the specified sequence. There&#39;s no relationship between
  the named sequence and the
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag; the view DAO only serves as a Java class where to place the
  corresponding Java method to retrieve the value.
</p>

<p>
  For details on the settings of a
  <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for Sequences.
</p>

<h2>The &lt;query&gt; Tag</h2>

<p>
  Each
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>
  tag can include one or more
  <code>&lt;query&gt;</code>
  tags. Each
  <code>&lt;query&gt;</code>
  tag contains a SQL statement the developer wants to attach as a method
  to the DAO. There&#39;s no relationship between the SQL statement and
  the view; the view DAO only serves as a Java class where to place the
  corresponding Java method that executes the SQL statement. The SQL
  statement must not necessarily be an SQL update, but can also be an
  SQL insert, or SQL delete.
</p>

  <code>&lt;query&gt;</code>
  tag see the Configuration Reference section for Updates.
