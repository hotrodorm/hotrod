<h1>Example 1 - CRUD Operations on Tables</h1>

<p>This example shows the basic out-of-the-box CRUD (create, read,
  update, delete) operations on a table of the database. This example
  shows how to operate on single rows identifying them by the PK
  (primary key) of the table; the PK is auto-generated as an identity
  key.</p>

<p>However, if the table did not have a PK, then only the insert
  operation would be available and the options to perform select,
  update, and delete would be more limited. We could still use the
  out-of-the-box select, update, and delete &ldquo;by example&rdquo;
  operations described on examples further on.</p>

<h2>DAO/VO class and its properties</h2>

<p>For each table Hotrod generates a DAO class that combines the DAO
  pattern (persistence methods) with the VO pattern (value object that
  represents a row of a table).</p>

<p>
  This example uses the
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  table to demonstrate the basic CRUD operations. HotRod created a DAO
  class
  <code>VehicleDAO</code>
  for this table. Its name is configurable but defaults to the table
  name with the DAO suffix.
</p>

<p>For each table column this class includes a property with a name
  and a specific Java type. Both are configurable: the name defaults to
  the column name in Java format, an the Java type defaults to a
  suitable Java type for each column. This Java type heavily depends on
  the specifics of the RDBMS.</p>

<h2>How to Run this example</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Example 01</strong> is included in the download package.
  To run this example please refer to the section <a
    href="http://How to Run the Examples">How to Run the Examples</a>
  above.<br />
</p>

<h2>Insert</h2>

<p>
  In this example, the section below shows how to insert a new row in
  the table
  <code>VEHICLE</code>
  :
</p>

<pre class="java">    VehicleDAO skoda = new VehicleDAO();
    skoda.setBrand("Skoda");
    skoda.setModel("Octavia");
    skoda.setUsed(false);
    skoda.setCurrentMileage(7);
    skoda.setPurchasedOn(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
    int rows = skoda.insert();
    System.out.println("New vehicle Skoda added. New ID=" + skoda.getId()
      + ". Rows inserted=" + rows);</pre>

<p>
  The
  <code>insert()</code>
  method is always available, regardless if the table has or has not a
  PK: you can always insert.
</p>

<p>
  It first instantiates a new object of the class
  <code>VehicleDAO</code>
  , then it set the property values for the row we want to insert, and
  finally it performs the
  <code>insert()</code>
  operation.
</p>

<p>There are a few things to note here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This example does not include any transaction demarcation
    (begin transaction and commit transaction). When no transaction
    demarcation is specified, each database operation commits
    automatically.</li>
  <li>The PK property <code>ID</code> was not set before inserting
    the row. Since HotRod was configured to treat this column as
    auto-generated its value is ignored while inserting and is populated
    right after the insert. In this case, the PK <code>ID</code> has the
    value of the newly inserted PK.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>insert()</code> method returns the number of
    affected rows.
  </li>
  <li>If the <code>insert()</code> operation fails by any reason an
    Exception is thrown. By default the checked <code>SQLException</code>
    is thrown, but can be also configured to throw the unchecked Mybatis
    <code>PersistenceException</code>. See the MyBatis Generator Options
    section.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Select by PK</h2>

<p>In this example, the section below shows how to select a row
  using the PK.</p>

<pre class="java">    VehicleDAO delorean = VehicleDAO.select(3);</pre>

<p>
  If the table has a PK, the DAO includes the
  <code>select()</code>
  method that retrieves a row by a PK value. This method is not present
  if the table does not have a PK.
</p>

<p>There are a few things to note here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>select()</code> method is static, so it&#39;s used
    from the DAO class itself.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>select()</code> method parameters are the PK
    values. For a composite PK, multiple parameters are used as needed.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>select()</code> method returns a single DAO object.
    If no row is found for the specified PK a null is returned.
  </li>
  <li>If the <code>select()</code> operation fails by any reason an
    Exception is thrown. By default the checked <code>SQLException</code>
    is thrown, but can be also configured to throw the unchecked Mybatis
    <code>PersistenceException</code>. See the MyBatis Generator Options
    section.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Update by PK</h2>

<p>In this example, the section below shows how to update a row
  using the PK.</p>

<pre class="java">    VehicleDAO delorean = VehicleDAO.select(3);

    // Update by PK: set the mileage of the DeLorean to 270500

    if (delorean != null) {
      delorean.setCurrentMileage(270500);
      rows = delorean.update();
      System.out.println("DeLorean updated. Rows updated=" + rows);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Could not update DeLorean. Car not found.");
    }</pre>

<p>
  If the table has a PK, the DAO includes the
  <code>update()</code>
  method that updates a row by the PK value. This method is not present
  if the table does not have a PK. The key section of this example are
  the two lines:
</p>

<pre class="java">      delorean.setCurrentMileage(270500);
      rows = delorean.update();</pre>

<p>This example retrieved a row using a Select by PK method (example
  above), then modified one property, and finally updated the row.</p>

<p>There are a few things to note here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>update()</code> method is not static. It operates
    on an object, not the class itself. All the non-PK columns
    (properties) are updated into the database row, including the
    unmodified properties.
  </li>
  <li>In this example, since some time passes between the <code>select()</code>
    and <code>update()</code> operations, it&#39;s technically possible
    that the table row could have been updated in the mean time by
    another process or thread. If so, the <code>update()</code>
    operation will override the other process&#39; values, effectively
    losing that information. To deal with this problem, you can use the
    pessimistic locking strategy (row locks or table locks), or use
    optimistic locking strategy (Row Version Control). The latter is
    implemented by HotRod and is described later in the section <a
    href="http://Optimistic Locking (Row Version Control)">Optimistic
      Locking (Row Version Control)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>This example does not include any transaction demarcation
    (begin transaction and commit transaction). When no transaction
    demarcation is specified, each database operation commits
    automatically.</li>
  <li>The <code>update()</code> method returns the number of
    affected rows. If there&#39;s no row for the specified PK values, it
    returns a zero.
  </li>
  <li>If the <code>update()</code> operation fails by any reason an
    Exception is thrown. By default the checked <code>SQLException</code>
    is thrown, but can be also configured to throw the unchecked Mybatis
    <code>PersistenceException</code>. See the MyBatis Generator Options
    section.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Delete By PK</h2>

<p>In this example, the section below shows how to delete a row
  using the PK.</p>

<pre class="java">    VehicleDAO toyota = new VehicleDAO();
    toyota.setId(2);
    rows = toyota.delete();</pre>

<p>
  If the table has a PK, the DAO includes the
  <code>delete()</code>
  method that deleted a row by the PK value. This method is not present
  if the table does not have a PK.
</p>

<p>
  It first uses an object of the class
  <code>VehicleDAO</code>
  , the sets the PK columns (one or more), and finally deletes the row.
</p>

<p>There are a few things to note here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>delete()</code> method is not static. It operates
    on an object, not the class itself. Only the PK columns are used.
    All other columns are ignored.
  </li>
  <li>This example does not include any transaction demarcation
    (begin transaction and commit transaction). When no transaction
    demarcation is specified, each database operation commits
    automatically.</li>
  <li>The <code>delete()</code> method returns the number of
    affected rows. If there&#39;s no row for the specified PK values, it
    returns a zero.
  </li>
  <li>If the <code>delete()</code> operation fails by any reason an
    Exception is thrown. By default the checked <code>SQLException</code>
    is thrown, but can be also configured to throw the unchecked Mybatis
    <code>PersistenceException</code>. See the MyBatis Generator Options
    section.
  </li>
</ul>
