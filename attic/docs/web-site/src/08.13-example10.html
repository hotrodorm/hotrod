<h1>Example 10 - Regular SQL Queries</h1>

<p>This example shows how to run regular SQL queies that do not
  return a result set. For SQL selects see example 12.</p>

<p>Regular SQL include DML (update, delete, insert, truncate, etc.)
  as well as DDL (create, drop, alter, etc.) SQL statements.</p>

<p>SQL queries must be configured in the configuration file. See the
  reference section for details on their syntax and how to define their
  parameters.</p>

<p>SQL queries are exposed in the DAOs as simple java methods with
  the configured java parameters.</p>

<p>Regular SQL Queries share the syntax with Native SQL and Dynamic
  SQL. They can be combined all at once when creating SQL statements.</p>

  To run this example please refer to the section How to Run the
  Examples above.
</p>

<h2>Case #1: Update with no parameters</h2>

<p>
  This case runs a SQL update to update a column on the client table.
  It&#39;s exposed as the
  <code>computeTotalPurchased()</code>
  method on the
  <code>ClientDAO</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #2: Complex update using parameters</h2>

<p>
  All the complexity of the SQL is hidden from the java code. It&#39;s
  simply exposed as the
  <code>upgradeToVIP(Integer minPurchases)</code>
  method on the
  <code>ClientDAO</code>
  .
</p>

<h2>Case #3: Delete using parameters</h2>

<p>
  All the complexity of the non-trivial SQL delete is hidden from the
  java code. It&#39;s exposed as the
  <code>deleteInactiveClients(java.sql.Data createdBefore)</code>
  method on the
  <code>ClientDAO</code>
  .
