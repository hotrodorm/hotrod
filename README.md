# HotRod 

HotRod is an open source ORM for Spring and Spring Boot geared towards high performance persistence for relational databases.

The persistence layer can be generated with a minimal configuration.


HotRod includes four modules:
- CRUD &mdash; Quick and simple persistence for rapid prototyping.
- LiveSQL &mdash; Flexible querying from Java.
- Nitro &mdash; Combine Native SQL with Dynamic SQL and Graph Queries.
- `Torcs` &mdash; Detect slow queries at runtime and analyze them.
