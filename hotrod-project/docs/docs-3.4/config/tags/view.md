# The `<view>` Tag

A `<view>` tag tells the HotRod generator to include a view in the code generation. Each `<view>` tag adds one database view
to the persistence layer.

## Attributes

In its simplest form this tag only specifies the view name. All view columns are inspected automatically and all DAO and VO
classes are generated according to the default settings. Names are produced in camel-case and property types are generated
according to the [default types for each database](../supported-databases.md).

The default rules for table and column names can be customized with [`<name-solver>`](./name-solver.md) rules. Data types
can also be customized with [`<type-solver>`](./type-solver.md) rules.

The `<view>` tag can include modifiers that can be useful in special cases, as shown below:

| Attribute | Description | Defaults to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of the view | Required |
| `catalog` | The catalog of the view, if different from the default one | The current catalog, specified in the runtime properties file |
| `schema` | The schema of the view, if different from the default one | The current schema, specified in the runtime properties file |
| `java-name` | Sets the base Java name for the DAO and VO classes | Camel-case identifier based on the database identifier |

## Included Tags

The `<table>` tag can include the following tags:
- Zero or more `<column>` tags to customize table columns.
- Zero or more `<sequence>` tags to generate methods that retrieve sequence values.
- Zero or more `<query>` tags to generate methods for parameterized general purpose queries.
- Zero or more `<select>` tags to generate methods for parameterized select queries.


## Customizing Columns

The most common case for customizing columns happens when the name or type generated by the default rules are not convenient for the application. 
In this case the `<column>` tag can directly specify the property name and type for a column. This tag is optional and can be included
only for the columns that need to be superseded.

See the [`<column>`](./column.md) tag for more details.


## Extra Persistence Methods

HotRod can add extra methods that could be related to the table to retrieve sequences, running general purpose queries, and Nitro queries.

See [`<sequence>`](sequence.md), [`<query>`](query.md), and [`<select>`](select.md).
