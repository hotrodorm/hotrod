# The `<auto-generated-column>` Tag

This tag specifies auto-generation details for table columns.

Nowadays most of the databases support `IDENTITY` generation for primary key columns and provide
comprehensive metadata about the primary key generation. When HotRod automatically detects these primary 
keys there's no need to use this tag to configure them.

This tag can be of use for primary keys that are generated using a database sequence, or when
the table includes more than one autogenerated column (only in PostgreSQL so far).


## Attributes

This tag can include the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Defaults to |
| -- | -- | -- |

| `sequence` | Specifies the sequence name | If not specified the column is considered to be IDENTITY |
| `always` | For an IDENTITY column this indicates if the it's marked as `IDENTITY GENERATED ALWAYS` (true) or `IDENTITY GENERATED BY DEFAULT` (false) | true |
