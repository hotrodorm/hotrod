Indexes can be created on virtual columns as long as they are persistent. That is the computed value of the columns is actually saved in the table structure.

First, create the persistent virtual column:

 alter table customer add column (reverse_last_name varchar(20) as (reverse(last_name)) persistent);

Then, add the index:

 create index customer_reverse_last on customer (reverse_last_name);
