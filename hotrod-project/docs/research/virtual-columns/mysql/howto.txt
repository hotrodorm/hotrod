MySQL supports virtual columns since version 5.7. 

Indexes can almost always be created on virtual columns. The only exception is a 
virtual column that acts as a PK. In this case the virtual column must be "stored"
in order to create an index on it.

First, create the persistent virtual column:

 alter table customer add reverse_last_name varchar(20) generated always as (reverse(last_name)) virtual;

Then, add the index:

 alter table customer add customer_reverse_last (reverse_last_name);
