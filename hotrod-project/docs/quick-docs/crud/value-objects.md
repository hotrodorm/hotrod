# Value Objects

Value Objects (VOs) are Java classes generated by the CRUD module to model rows of a database table or view.

All tables and views mentioned in the [Configuration File](../config/configuration-file-structure.md) are inspected
for details of their columns. Each table and view results in one class and each column of them results in
one property of the corresponding class.

The naming of value objects is configured in the [Generator](../config/tags/mybatis-spring.md) as well as by
the [Name Solver](../config/tags/name-solver.md) rules. The types of the properties are decided by the 
[Type Solver](../config/tags/type-solver.md) rules, and in the absence of it, by default rules according to 
each specific database.


## Value Object Modeling

This is a key concept that CRUD implements to keep the Java model in sync with the database changes seamlessly.

The CRUD module models a value object as two separate classes. A parent class that mimics the database structure
with all properties from the database and no methods for behavior, and an initially empty child class where extra
properties and methods can be added. All custom logic is concentrated in the child class, while the parent represents
the database and can be updated any time the database structure changes, without overwriting the custom behavior.
See [Value Object Modeling](./value-object-modeling.md) for more details.
