# Insert

The `insert()` method receives a VO with the properties of the row to be inserted in a table.

This method can also be used in a view, depending on the database specific rules and the
details of the view definition.


## Auto-Generated Columns, Identity Columns &amp; Sequences

Auto-generated columns are columns that are generated by the database automatically on each insert.
They can take four forms:

- `IDENTITY GENERATED ALWAYS`: The database always generates a value for this column. The `INSERT`
functionality cannot specify it.
- `IDENTITY GENERATED BY DEFAULT`: The database generates this value when the `INSERT` functionality
does not include it, or when it includes it with a null.
- Columns generated by sequences.
- `DEFAULT` constraints: CRUD does not populate back the values of columns that have a `DEFAULT`
constraint to produce their values. The developer can use an extra `SELECT` to retrieve their values.

Nowadays most databases inform the auto-generation properties of a column, and CRUD automatically 
implements the insertion logic according to it. For the use of sequences or when the database engine
does not provide auto-generation metadata the
[`<auto-generated-column>`](../config/tags/auto-generated-column.md) tag in the configuration can
be added to so CRUD knows how to handle a specific column.

If a table column is marked as `IDENTITY GENERATED ALWAYS` the value provided by the VO is ignored
and populated back from the database once the row is inserted. 

If a table column is marked as `IDENTITY GENERATED BY DEFAULT` there are two cases. If the value
provided by the VO is null, this value is populated back from the database once the row is inserted. If
the value provided by the VO is not null this value is used as an insertion value.


## Example

The example shown below includes two tables with Identity columns and one that uses a sequence:
