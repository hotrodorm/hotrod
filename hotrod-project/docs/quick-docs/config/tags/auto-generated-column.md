# The `<auto-generated-column>` Tag

This tag specifies auto-generation details for table columns.

Nowadays most of the databases support `IDENTITY` generation for primary key columns. HotRod 
automatically detects these primary keys and there's no need to use this tag for them.

This tag can be of use for primary keys that are generated using a database sequence, or when
the table includes more than one autogenerated column (only in PostgreSQL so far).


## Attributes

This tag can include the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Defaults to |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `name` | The column name | Required |
| `sequence` | Specifies the sequence name | If not specified the column is considered to be IDENTITY |
| `always` | For an IDENTITY column this indicates if the it's marked as `IDENTITY GENERATED ALWAYS` (true) or `IDENTITY GENERATED BY DEFAULT` (false) | true |
