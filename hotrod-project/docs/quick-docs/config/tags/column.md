# The `<column>` Tag

This tag can be used to override the default name and/or type of a property related to a database column, 
or to specify a type converter for it.

It can also be used to specify the use of a sequence to generate values for the column, or to specify the cycling 
values for a version column used for optimistic locking.

## Attributes

It can include the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Defaults to |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `name` | The database column name | Required |
| `java-name` | Sets the Java property name | Rule from `<name-solver>` or camel-case name |
| `java-type` | Sets the Java property type | Rule from `<type-solver>` or default database type |
| `converter` | Defines a converter for the column. See [`<converter>`](converter.md) | Mutually exclusive with `java-type` |
| `jdbc-type` | Sets the JDBC type for inserting or updating nulls in the database [^1] | Default database JDBC type |
| `sequence` | Specifies the column value is generated by a sequence during `INSERT`s | N/A |
| `catalog` | The catalog of the sequence (if any) | N/A |
| `schema` | The schema of the sequence (if any) | N/A |
| `is-lob`  | Influences the reading and writing strategies of a LOB | N/A |
| `initial-value` | Overrides initial value for [optimistic locking](./version-control-column.md) | According to the database type |
| `min-value` | Overrides minimum value for [optimistic locking](./version-control-column.md) | According to the database type |
| `max-value` | Overrides maximum value for [optimistic locking](./version-control-column.md) | According to the database type |

[^1] This is a requirement of the JDBC spec where each nulls needs to be specifying when applied as a query parameter.

## Custom Name &amp; Type

As described before the naming of the column properties and their types follow rules specified by the `<name-solver>` and `<type-solver>` and,
in the absence of these, follow default rules that depend on each database.

Nonetheless, if the name or type of the column produced by the rules above is not suitable for one or more columns, you can add a `<column>` tag
that can set its name or type directly.

For example, if the following table is created (PostgreSQL) as:

```sql
create table invoice (
  id int primary key not null,
  ux_pre_tax_amt decimal(10, 2),
  tax_percent decimal(6, 4),
  created_at timestamp,
  status int check (status in (1, 2, 5, 6))
)
```

By default HotRod will generate the following columns and types:

| Database Column | VO Property | VO Type |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ID | id | Integer |
| CREATED_AT | createdAt | java.sql.Timestamp |
| TAX_PCT | taxPercent | java.math.BigDecimal |
| UX_TOT_TAX_AMT | uxTotTaxAmt | java.math.BigDecimal |
| STATUS | status | String |

If we wanted to override these names and types and decided for:
- `CREATED_AT` as `java.time.LocalDateTime`.
- `TAX_PC` with the property name `taxPercent`.
- `UX_TOT_TAX_AMT` with the property name `totalAmount` and type `Double`.
- `STATUS` to be represented by a Java enum (maybe with values `CREATED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `PAID`).

We can use `<column>` tags to set them as needed:

```xml
  <table name="invoice">
    <column name="created_at" java-type="java.time.LocalDateTime" />
    <column name="tax_pct" java-name="taxPercent" />
    <column name="ux_tot_tax_amt" java-name="totalAmount" java-type="Double" />
    <column name="status" converter="invoiceStatusConverter" />
  </table>
```

The columns that are not mentioned are not affected and their names and types use the default rules. Note,
also, that changes can be combined in the same tag, as shown for the column `UX_TOT_TAX_AMT` that sets its
name and type.

The `jdbc-type` is rarely used, but can become handy for exotic types or when using old JDBC drivers that do
not know how to deal with these uncommon column types. For example, when trying to insert a GEOMETRY value with an old
driver or when inserting an UUID value that needs to use the `BINARY`.
