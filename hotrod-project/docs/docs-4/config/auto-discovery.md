# Auto-Discovery of Tables &amp; Views

HotRod discovers tables and views and adds them to the persistent layer automatically when no `<table>`, `<view>`, or `<dao>` tags are 
present in the configuration.

This feature can also be enabled if any of these tags are present to combine auto-discovery with tables and views 
configured in an explicit way.
