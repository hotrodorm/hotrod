For 3.x:
- Rename Structured Queries to Graph Queries.
- Clean annotations in the Hello World and the Projects from Scratch.

Then:
- Fork version 3.4.9-SNAPSHOT, so 4.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT will become master.
- Create two copies of the documentation: one for 3.4 and the other for 4.x (upcoming).

For 4.0:
- Disable or remove the "create-view" engine.
- Simplify the configuration file, specially the <daos> tag.
- Remove the "generator" property. It's not useful.
- Document the dialects for single and multiple datasources.
